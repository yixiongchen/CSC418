CSC 418 - Assignment 1 Report File

In this file you must:

__________________________________________________________________
1) Describe *briefly* and *concisely* what parts of the assignment
   you found easier, harder, and/or tricky to get right


The easy part is add controllers, I just followed the example, 
and did the rest. The hardest part is implementation of rule1, first
I need tp calculate the distance between Boids, then compute the center
of mass. Rule 2 and Rule 3 are easier tha rule 1.The most time-consuming
part is drawing the Boids. 
__________________________________________________________________
2) Answer any //QUESTION: items noted in the code

Question 1:

Question 2:





__________________________________________________________________
3) Describe any //CRUNCHY: extensions you implemented

I add implementation to make birds flap in the air

4) Briefly comment on the following:

a) What is the time complexity of the boid update (in big Oh notation),
   justify.
   Answer:  O(n^2), each Boids need to compare with every other boids

b) What could you do to make the update more efficient?
   Answer: 

c) What is the greatest bottleneck of the program:

    Is it the boid update code?
    Or is it the boid display code?

    Why is that? justify your answer.

d) How would you adapt the idea behind Boids to swarms of running
   creatures (e.g. a herd of charging animals, an army of CGI
   monsters, a crowd of simulated humans walking). Think of the
   specific conditions you would need to add to the simulation
   that are different from your Boids implementation
